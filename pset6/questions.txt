    The for loop spell checks each word character-by-character. It appends chracters to the word array while ignoring
    numbers and strings that have more than the given, fixed length. Then, once it reaches the end of the string, the function
    prepares for a new word. Once a whole word is found, the current word in the word array is terminated, the counter is updated,
    and the spelling is checked. If the word is misspelled, the function prints that word. Then it once again prepares
    for the next word.
